The cakes they made were delicious, unlike anything anyone had tasted. As a result, their friends and family asked them to entertain more and more. They quickly realized this side project of theirs could be something more. There was a gap in the world for delicious cakes, readily available, that didn't compromise on their ingredients. Fresh eggs, real butter, and real cream cheese; nothing was too good to achieve perfection. And perfection is those decadent, slowly melting bites, we all know and love. Flash forward and the Nothing Bundt Cakes brand has grown nationwide.

The three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) are now allowing contracting companies to collect rental data on their behalf in order to boost credit scores! Did you know that your credit scores need monthly activity in order to grow exponentially? No activity, your score remains dormant for years?&nbsp; Therefore, a renter with a 500 credit score, who pays rent on time, has little chance of ever buying a home that requires a 620 credit score. How does this work, you ask? It is really quite simple. You provide us with a copy of your identification,&nbsp; a copy of your lease, and pay a small yearly fee or a monthly fee.
